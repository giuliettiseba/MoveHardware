I do not guarantee that it is correct, so use it at your own risk.  If you use

It would also be nice if my name and URL were left in the comments.  But none

The Crypto++ Library uses portions of Andy Polyakov's CRYPTOGAMS on Linux
for 32-bit ARM with files aes_armv4.S, sha1_armv4.S and sha256_armv4.S.
CRYPTOGAMS is dual licensed with a permissive BSD-style license. The
CRYPTOGAMS license is reproduced below. You can disable Cryptogams code by
undefining the relevant macros in config_asm.h.

The Crypto++ Library uses portions of Jack Lloyd's Botan for ChaCha SSE2 and
AVX. Botan placed the code in public domain for Crypto++ to use.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Attribution 2.0 England and Wales

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL 
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT 
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. 
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, 
AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

Licence

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY 
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS 
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING 
ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE 
TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN 
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

This Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence enables You (all 
capitalised terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and 
distribute Works worldwide, provided that You credit the Original Author.

'The Licensor' [one or more legally recognised persons or entities offering 
the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence]

and

'You'

agree as follows:

1. Definitions

"Attribution" means acknowledging all the parties who have contributed to and 
have rights in the Work, Derivative Work or Collective Work under this Licence.
"Collective Work" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along 
with a number of other separate and independent works, assembled into a 
collective whole.
"Derivative Work" means any work created by the editing, modification, 
adaptation or translation of the Work in any media (however a work that 
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for 
the purpose of this Licence). For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a 
musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in 
timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a 
Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Licence" means this Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence 
agreement.
"Original Author" means the individual (or entity) who created the Work.
"Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms 
of this Licence.
For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, 
words in the singular number include the plural number.
2. Licence Terms

2.1 The Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
non-exclusive, Licence for use and for the duration of copyright in the Work.

You may:

copy the Work;
create one or more Derivative Works;
incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works;
copy Derivative Works or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work; and
publish, distribute, archive, perform or otherwise disseminate the Work, 
Derivative Works or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work, to the 
public in any material form in any media whether now known or hereafter 
created.
HOWEVER,

You must not:

impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work, the Derivative Work or 
the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that alter or restrict the 
terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or has the effect or 
intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights;
impose any digital rights management technology on the Work, the Derivative 
Work or the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that alters or 
restricts the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or has the 
effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights;
sublicense the Work;
subject the Work to any derogatory treatment as defined in the Copyright, 
Designs and Patents Act 1988.
FINALLY,

You must:

make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken 
word or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and 
Derivative Works and Collective Works published, distributed, performed or 
otherwise disseminated or made available to the public by You;
recognise the Licensor's / Original Author's right of attribution in any 
Work, Derivative Work and Collective Work that You publish, distribute, 
perform or otherwise disseminate to the public and ensure that You credit the 
Licensor / Original Author as appropriate to the media used; and
to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all notices that refer to 
this Licence, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to 
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright 
notice or licensing information for the Work.
Additional Provisions for third parties making use of the Work

2.2. Further licence from the Licensor

Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate

the Work; or
any Derivative Work; or
the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work
the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party making use of the 
Work (in any of the alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Work on 
the same terms and conditions as granted to You hereunder.

2.3. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may have under any 
applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally 
recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.

2.4. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved, 
including but not limited to, the exclusive right to collect, whether 
individually or via a licensing body, such as a collecting society, royalties 
for any use of the Work.

3. Warranties and Disclaimer

Except as required by law, the Work or any Derivative Work is licensed by the 
Licensor on an "as is" and "as available" basis and without any warranty of 
any kind, either express or implied.

4. Limit of Liability

Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the 
Licensor shall not be liable and hereby expressly excludes all liability for 
loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.

5. Termination

The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically 
upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities 
who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this 
Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such 
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those Licences.

6. General

6.1. The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this agreement 
is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or 
unenforceable.

6.2. This Licence constitutes the entire Licence Agreement between the 
parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, 
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. 
The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear 
in any communication in any form.

6.3. A person who is not a party to this Licence shall have no rights under 
the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.

6.4. This Licence shall be governed by the law of England and Wales and the 
parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of 
England and Wales.

7. On the role of Creative Commons

7.1. Neither the Licensor nor the User may use the Creative Commons logo 
except to indicate that the Work is licensed under a Creative Commons 
Licence. Any permitted use has to be in compliance with the Creative Commons 
trade mark usage guidelines at the time of use of the Creative Commons trade 
mark. These guidelines may be found on the Creative Commons website or be 
otherwise available upon request from time to time.

7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its role 
in providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims of any Licensor 
or user of the Licence.

7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires of the 
Licensor and You is an acknowledgement of its limited role and agreement by 
all who use the Licence that the Corporation is not responsible to anyone for 
the statements and actions of You or the Licensor or anyone else attempting 
to use or using this Licence.

7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and makes 
no warranty whatsoever in connection to the Work or in connection to the 
Licence, and in all events is not liable for any loss or damage resulting 
from the Licensor's or Your reliance on this Licence or on its enforceability.

7.5. USE OF THIS LICENCE MEANS THAT YOU AND THE LICENSOR EACH ACCEPTS THESE 
CONDITIONS IN SECTION 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 AND EACH ACKNOWLEDGES CREATIVE 
COMMONS CORPORATION'S VERY LIMITED ROLE AS A FACILITATOR OF THE LICENCE FROM 
THE LICENSOR TO YOU.

Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty 
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable 
to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including 
without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages 
arising in connection to this licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) 
sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the 
Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is 
licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative 
Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the 
prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in 
compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as 
may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from 
time to time.

Creative Commons may be contacted at https://creativecommons.org/.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This application uses SQLite which has been dedicated to
- the public domain
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: https://sqlite.org/copyright.html

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies
they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the
public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe
at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, 
compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code
form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in
SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship
with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for
example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other
open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final
deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those
scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the
SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code
has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of
code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have
public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is
uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

THINKGEO, LLC
SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
VERY IMPORTANT – READ CAREFULLY
NOTICE TO USERS: CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”).
USE OF THE THINKGEO SOFTWARE PROVIDED WITH THIS AGREEMENT (THE “SOFTWARE”) CONSTITUTES
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT,
DO NOT INSTALL AND/OR USE THIS SOFTWARE. USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS CONDITIONED UPON
COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. LICENSE GRANT. ThinkGeo, LLC (“ThinkGeo”) grants Licensee a license to use one copy
of the version of the Software on any one system for as many licenses as are purchased,
except as modified by the stipulations provided for in this Agreement relating to each
Software Product Type. “Licensee” means the company, organization, entity, or individual
whose funds are used to pay the license fee. “Use” means storing, loading, installing,
executing or displaying the Software on a user workstation, or as otherwise specified
according to the Software Product Type later in this Agreement. Licensee is expected
to use the trial version of the Software on Licensee’s computer system and to
thoroughly evaluate its usefulness and functionality before making a purchase.
Licensee understands and agrees that there is no refund policy for any purchase of
the Software. The license to use this Software may not be transferred to any other
company, organization, or entity without the express written consent of ThinkGeo.

2. SOFTWARE PRODUCT TYPES:

a. DEVELOPMENT TOOLKIT: “Development Toolkit” means the “Software” of a type that
is designed to be used by a person who is a software developer to create custom
software applications. A Development Toolkit is licensed on a per developer basis,
with one license per each developer. Only the individual developer to whom a
Development Toolkit license is registered may access, install on a computer, or
otherwise use in any way the retail version of the Development Toolkit. Licensee
must provide registration information to ThinkGeo which clearly identifies the
developer to whom each purchased license is assigned for use. In the event that
Licensee wishes to transfer the Development Toolkit license to a different
developer in Licensee’s organization, Licensee must promptly notify ThinkGeo of
the proposed transfer and register the new developer with ThinkGeo.
Licensee may deploy (install) any compiled final user applications created
from the Development Toolkit to final user workstations, free of any royalty
charges, provided the following conditions are satisfied:
i) The application does not expose any API (application program interface),
methods, classes, functions, or properties (such as in the meaning of scripting
functionality); and
ii) The application is not competitive with any ThinkGeo product. For purposes of
clarification, competitive is defined the marketing and/or distribution of a product
to the general GIS software user market which, in the judgment of ThinkGeo, contains
a significant set of the features found in any ThinkGeo product which makes the
application compete with ThinkGeo for market share. This includes applications that
are provided without charge.
If Licensee is unsure whether its application is in compliance with the conditions
above, Licensee shall contact ThinkGeo with the specific details of its situation
and ask for clarification. Any use of the Development Toolkit to create an application
which is an exception to either of the aforementioned conditions requires the express
written permission from ThinkGeo and may be subject to ThinkGeo royalties.
Licensee is allowed to deploy an application created from the Development Toolkit to
any kind of server situation (to provide data over the internet or any kind of network
or multi-user environment) ONLY if a Server Deployment License for the Development
Toolkit has been purchased from ThinkGeo. One Server Deployment License must be
purchased for each production server computer to which the application or solution is
deployed. For purposes of clarification, a Server Deployment License is required for
each deployment to a production server computer regardless of whether the deployment
is performed within the organization that has licensed the Development Toolkit or to
a server of another organization and regardless of whether the server deployment is
for back-up, marketing, or other purposes.
Licensee may not disable any licensing, security, or control features of the
Development Toolkit software. Unless a license to access and use the source code for
the Development Toolkit was purchased from ThinkGeo, Licensee may not modify the
Development Toolkit except as an intended part of the Development Toolkit programming
features. You may not recompile, distribute, disseminate, resell, rent, lease, or
share the Development Toolkit software or components or libraries of the Development
Toolkit with other companies, organizations, entities, or individuals without the
express written consent of ThinkGeo, except as a compiled end user application created
from the Development Toolkit.
If a license to access and use Development Toolkit source code has been purchased from
ThinkGeo, Licensee is allowed to share modifications made to the Development Toolkit
source code only with other members of Licensee’s company or organization who are also
licensed to access and use the same source code version of Development Toolkit.
b. SERVER PRODUCT: “Server Product” means the Software of a type that is designed to
function as a server and thereby provide data over the internet or any kind of network
or multi-user environment. The Server Product is licensed on a per server basis,
requiring the purchase of one license per each installation on a server computer of the
Server Product or any solution or application created from or using the Server Product.
One license must be purchased for each production server installation, regardless of
whether the production server installation is for the purpose of marketing, back-up, or
other purposes.
Licensee may not modify the Server Product or disable any licensing, control, security,
or copyright features of the Server Product except as an intended part of the Server
Product programming features or user interface. Licensee may not deploy, distribute,
resell, lease, rent, share, or otherwise disseminate the Software to other companies,
organizations, entities, or individuals without the express written consent of
ThinkGeo, unless the deployment, distribution, or dissemination is covered by the
purchase of a Server Product license.
c. END USER APPLICATION: “End-User Application” means the Software of a type that is
designed to be used on a workstation computer by a final user to perform a function
or type of work. Each license of an End-User Application grants the right to install
and run the End-User Application on a single computer for use by a single person at
any one time.
Licensee may not modify the End-User Application or disable any licensing, control,
security, or copyright features of the End-User Application except as an intended
part of the End-User Application’s user features. Licensee may not deploy,
distribute, resell, rent, lease, share or otherwise disseminate the Software to
other companies, organizations, entities, or individuals, unless it is covered by
the purchase of the appropriate number of user license(s).
d. EVALUATION VERSION: “Evaluation Version” means the Software that is provided
for the purpose of learning about the Software in order to make an informed
decision whether or not to purchase a license to use Software. Licensee is granted
an evaluation period of not more than sixty (60) days to use the Evaluation Version,
after which time you must either pay for the Software according to the terms and
prices provided by ThinkGeo or remove the Evaluation Version from Licensee’s
computer system. An Evaluation Version may not be used for any commercial purposes.
Licensee may not modify the Software or disable any licensing, control, security,
or copyright features of the Software except as an intended part of the Evaluation
Version’s programming or user interface features. Licensee may not deploy, distribute,
resell, rent, share, or disseminate the Evaluation Version to other companies,
organizations, entities, or individuals without the express written consent of
ThinkGeo.
e. FREE PRODUCT: “Free Product” is the Software that is generally disseminated by
ThinkGeo for use by the general public without any charge. Licensee may install and
use the Free Product as it is designed, for commercial or non commercial purposes,
with no limit on the time of use. Licensee may also post, redistribute, copy, and
share the Free Product without limitations, provided that i) the original ThinkGeo
copyright and logo information on the product’s user interface and in the “About”
box remains unchanged; and ii) Licensee does not charge for any such redistribution
of the Free Product other than a nominal fee to compensate for the cost of the
distribution media. Licensee may not modify the Free Product or disable any licensing,
control, security, or copyright features of the Software except as an intended part
of the Free Product’s user interface. Licensee may not misrepresent the ownership of
the Free Product.
3. REGISTRATION INFORMATION. Licensee is required to provide ThinkGeo with accurate
and valid registration information, including your name, identity, address, telephone
number, and e-mail address, and any subsequent changes to Licensee’s registration
information. Supplying false, incomplete, or misleading information is a violation
of this Agreement. ThinkGeo reserves the right to record the number of installations
and uninstalls of the software by the Licensee. ThinkGeo may require the Licensee to
enter in a serial key when installing the software so the license can be validated
over the Internet, if the license cannot be validated the installation of the software
may be prevented. In addition to the serial key the software installer may record
other non personal information to validate that the Licensee is in compliance with
the terms of this agreement. ThinkGeo will abide by the terms of its privacy policy,
which prevents it from disseminating such registration information to others without
the consent of the owner of the information.
4. OWNERSHIP. The Software is owned and copyrighted by ThinkGeo, a for profit limited
liability company organized under the laws of the State of Texas in the United States
of America. Any license granted under this Agreement confers no title or ownership in
the Software and should not be construed as a sale of any ownership right in the Software.
5. COPYRIGHT. The Software is protected by copyright law and international treaty
provisions. Licensee acknowledges that no title to the intellectual property in the
Software is transferred to it. Licensee further acknowledges that title and full
ownership rights to the Software will remain the exclusive property of ThinkGeo and
Licensee will not acquire any rights to the Software except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement. Licensee agrees that any copies of the Software will contain the same
proprietary notices which appear on and in the Software.
6. REVERSE ENGINEERING. Licensee agrees that it will not attempt to reverse compile,
modify, translate, or disassemble the Software in whole or in part.
7. RESTRICTED COUNTRIES. Licensee agrees that the Software will not be sold to,
transferred to, exported or re-exported into (or to a national or resident of) any
country to which the United States embargoes goods, or to anyone or any country on
the US Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the US Commerce
Department's Table of Denial Orders. Restricted countries currently include, but
are not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
8. LIMITED WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS. LICENSEE ACCEPTS THE SOFTWARE “AS IS”.
THINKGEO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS. THINKGEO DOE NOT WARRANT AND DISCLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET
LICENSEE’S NEEDS; OR THAT THE SOFTWARE IS ERROR FREE, FAULT TOLERANT OR FAIL SAFE.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL THINKGEO OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO
LICENSEE FOR THE COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSITUTE GOODS; LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR
BUSINESS EXPENDITURES; INVESTMENTS; BUSINESS COMMITMENTS; LOSS OF ANY GOODWILL; OR
FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT
OF THE DELIVERY, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THINKGEO HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL THINKGEO’S LIABILITY FOR ANY
CLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE LICENSE
FEE PAID.
10. INDEMNIFICATION. Licensee shall, at its expense, indemnify defend, save and hold
harmless ThinkGeo from any claim brought or filed by a third party against ThinkGeo
solely due to any failure by Licensee, its employees or agents to act in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, provided (a) ThinkGeo promptly gives Licensee written
notice of the claim; (b) ThinkGeo provides all reasonable assistance at Licensee's
expense to defend against the claim; and © Licensee has the right to control the defense
or settlement of the claim provided that Licensee does not enter into any settlement or
compromise that imposes any obligation or liability upon ThinkGeo without ThinkGeo's
prior written consent.
11. EQUITABLE RELIEF. Licensee agrees that any breach of this Agreement by Licensee
may cause irreparable damage and that, in the event of such breach, in addition to
any and all remedies at law, ThinkGeo shall have the right to seek an injunction,

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,

   each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,

   this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or 
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You 
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from 
      the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
      to any part of the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,

      those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
      least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part
      of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
      along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the 
      Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. 
      The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
      modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
      Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
      the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
      provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies

   the content of the NOTICE file.
   
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)
   on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express 
   or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, 
   NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are 
   solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing
   the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under
   this License.
   
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
   tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable
   law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, 
   shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
   indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising
   as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
   (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
   computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
   even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 
   acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
   and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
   obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, 
   not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
   claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such 
   warranty or additional liability. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

  or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  meet the following conditions:

  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	  stating that You changed the files; and

  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	  the Derivative Works; and

  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	  as modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
------------------------------------------

The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
PCRE2 independently.

arising out of the use of or inability to use this software.

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
freely, subject to the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:

    1. Redistributions of source code (in whole or in part) must retain
       the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list
       of conditions.

    2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries)
       must reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer,
       and this list of conditions in documentation and/or other materials
       provided with the distribution.  The sole exception to this condition
       is redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as
       part of a self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion
       of this license, as long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed
       from the binary or disabled.

    3. Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating
       systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with
       modified or added functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library
       versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not
       be misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries,
       compiled from the original source.  Such altered versions also must not
       be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP releases--including, but not
       limited to, labeling of the altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP"
       (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to, different
       capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
       explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further
       prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
       e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
       will provide support for the altered versions.

    4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
       "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its
       own source and binary releases.
